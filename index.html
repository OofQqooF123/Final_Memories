			<h1>Final Memories</h1>
			<h2>By: Anotine Miko Dellosa</h2>
			<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
			<h3>As the sun goes down,</h3>
			<h3>I can see my soul hiding in the shadows.</h3>
			<h3>No resasons were given</h3>
			<h3>That's how life goes.</h3>
			<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
			<h3>Perhaps this is how it ends.</h3>
			<h3>As I try to fend</h3>
			<h3>Against the shadoes in the darkness,</h3>
			<h3>I try to end my feelings of dread.</h3>
			<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
			<h3>While the darkness grows,</h3>
			<h3>A doorway opens.</h3>
			<h3>Here is not forever</h3>
			<h3>And life always ends.</h3>
